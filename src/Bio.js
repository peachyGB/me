        Hi I'm Georgia but some people like to call me Peachy. I answer to both.
        I like to make things that tickle the mind and/or your funny bone. I
        also work to develop projects that are accesible and easy to use for all
        people. In my free time I like to play games, explore NYC parks with my
        dog, and play music. As ive come to know myself throughout the years I
        have found that I work well under pressure or what I like to refer to as
        "grace under fire." I like to solve problems on LeetCocde, in web
        development, or even in my friends relationships with their upstairs
        neighbors. I love my work and I hope to share my passion with the people
        I spend my days with.
      </p>
